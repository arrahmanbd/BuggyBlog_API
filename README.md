# ðŸ‘ŒBuggyBlog_API 
APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, allow different software systems to communicate with each other. I have created a simple Blogging API that allows users to authenticate, create blog posts, get all blog posts, and get a particular blog post. I have also implemented routes that allows users to signup for a blogging account, and log into their accounts. Password encryption and Json Web Token Mechanism added for extra security.
More feature coming soon.ðŸ¤™
